# JStockFish-Kotlin
This is a Kotlin version of the JStockFish Chess engine for use on Android. 

The original Java files came from the following repo: https://github.com/ngocdaothanh/JStockfish?tab=readme-ov-file

## Setup Files

In all the files within the `kotlin` folder you must replace the line `package [your_package_name].jstockfish` with your package name. The same thing needs to be done for all of the `JNI` functions in the `jstockfish-lib.cpp` file.
